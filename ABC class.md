> The main purpose of using Abstract class is that it allows you to consider a common type of collection rather than coding for each type of collection


> Python has five abstract base classes. They are as follows:
	- Callable (__call__)
	- Container (__contains__)
	- Hashable (__hash__)
	- Iterable (__iter__)
	- Sized (__len__)
