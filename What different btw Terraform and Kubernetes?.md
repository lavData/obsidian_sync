### **Infrastructure provisioning**

Both Terraform and Kubernetes provision infrastructure, but at different levels. Terraform provides and manages resources such as virtual machines or cloud instances, networks, storage, and other components in your cloud environment. Alternately, Kubernetes provisions infrastructure for container workloads only.

### **Level of abstraction**

Terraform operates at a higher level of abstraction, managing resources and their configurations across cloud environments. Kubernetes operates at a lower level of abstraction, focusing on the deployment and lifecycle of containers within a cluster. It provides features for load balancing, networking, service discovery, and scaling of containers.
